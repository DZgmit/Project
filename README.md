This is my public repository with 8 java codes.
To run the code simply just download any file named
"Exercise". Then open the file using for example Notepad.
Copy the code and go to codechef.com - Practice - Code Compile & Run.
This will open an online Java Compiler, then make sure you
select Java language in top-left corner.
Paste the code, scroll down and click RUN.
