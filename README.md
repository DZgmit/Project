This is my public GitHub repository with 8 java codes.
To run the code simply just click View Code button in "master" branch
above and download any file named "Exercise".
Then open the file using for example Notepad.
Copy the code and go to codechef.com - Practice - Code Compile & Run.
This will open an online Java Compiler, then make sure you
select Java language in top-left corner.
Paste the code, scroll down and click RUN.
